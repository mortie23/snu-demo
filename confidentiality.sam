# ConfidentialityRule.sam: Sets one or more random rounding rules.
# This macro sets up a method to apply one or more selected random rounding rules. 
# The rules available are the same as those available in SuperCROSS via confid.ini,
# ie 0-3 Rounding,Random Rounding,1-4 Rounding and Graduated Rounding 
 
# SA Configuration Options: 
# set RULESET in confidentialityrule.dll with any reasonable combinations from the following values:
# NK(3,75)|FREQ(30)|0-3 Rounding|Random Rounding|1-4 Rounding|Graduated Rounding|THRESHOLD(300)
# Each rule must be separated by | and the rules specified in the property will be executed 
# in the same sequential order as in the property value string. 
 
# NK(3,75) is a concealment rule based on top n contributors. 3 and 75 are configurable.
# FREQ(30) is a concealment rule based on number of contributors. 30 is configurable.
# THRESHOLD(300) is a concealment rule based on the value itself. 300 is configurable.
# 0-3 Rounding,Random Rounding,1-4 Rounding and Graduated Rounding are existing rules in SX. 
 
# Requirements:
# confidentialityrule.dll must exist in same directory as scsa.exe
 
# Removing methods in case they already exist

method F30 remove increfs
method "0-3" remove increfs
